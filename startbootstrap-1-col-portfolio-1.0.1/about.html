    <p>My interest for the use of multimedia in computing was initially realised and developed with my introduction to Website Production; Unit 28 of my Level 3 Diploma in ICT course I am currently studying. I have always enjoyed new technology, but never truly appreciated it due to being part of a generation that grew up with fast developing new technologies until I started studying for my diploma. The Website Production unit of the course really brought to my attention what it took to build a functioning website – something I had always taken for granted. Beginning with basic HTML and Notepad, I built my very first website. I immediately wanted to learn more and find out what I would need to do to make a page similar to popular sites I regularly use, and so we moved onto Microsoft Expression Web 4 and I was overwhelmed by the possibilities.</p>
    <p>My desire to learn more grew further as I participated in a two week work experience placement at Moneysupermarket.com where my knowledge of different languages used to make webpages quickly expanded. Using video tutorials and websites like codecademy.com, w3schools.com and codeschool.com I learnt the uses and applications for languages for HTML5, CSS, Sass and Scss and began to build a new Cinema website which was more complex than my previous websites. Other tutorials and online classes that I completed during this time included lessons in typography, colour schemes and palettes for websites, designs and layouts for aesthetically pleasing webpages and tutorials for responsive design on the web. I still regularly use these websites and tutorials to keep my knowledge topped up and to stay in practice. These have greatly improved my ability to make aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.</p>
    <p>I have also participated in voluntary work for Barnardo’s Charity shop, ran the Cancer Research Race for Life and organised a beverage sale to support and raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust. As part of the Working with Others Essential Skill qualification, I took on the role of the leader of the group to organise a beverage sale for the Teenage Cancer Trust. My tasks and responsibilities included delegating and overseeing tasks, ensuring they were being completed by my team mates, ordering and storing the stock for the sale and acting as treasurer for the group.</p>
    <p>Moneysupermarket.com invited me to help at a CoderDojo they were hosting to teach kids the very basics of programming using MIT’s Scratch programming language to encourage them to become enthused and as interested as I am in computing. This was an excellent opportunity for the children and myself, as it encouraged us to use our problem solving, communication and working with others skills. It also gave me some experience in teaching which was fantastic and really helped to promote my leadership skills, and helped me grow as an individual. </p>
    <p>The website I am currently building for my Multimedia Design project uses a free bootstrap model to promote a game using text, images, video, audio and animations. I am attending weekly lessons at Moneysupermarket.com to help me learn how to improve my website, expanding my enthusiasm for multimedia design and usage in computing.</p>
    <p>I would like to gain more independence and extend my knowledge and creativity from attending university and I hope to be able to build a portfolio using the experience and insight gained from this course. </p>
